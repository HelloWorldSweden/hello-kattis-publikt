\noindent
About $90$ percent of the 300 billion emails sent every day are spam. Thus, a
fast spam detection mechanism is crucial for large email providers. Lots of spammers try
to circumvent spam detection by rewriting words like
``{\tt M0n3y}'', ``{\tt Ca\$h}'', or ``{\tt Lo||ery}''.

A very simple and fast spam detection mechanism is based on the ratios between
whitespace characters, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and symbols. Symbols are
defined as characters that do not fall in one of the first three groups.

\section*{Input}

The input consists of:
\begin{itemize}
	\item one line with a string consisting of at least $1$ and at most $100\,000$ characters.
\end{itemize}
A preprocessing step has already transformed all whitespace characters to
underscores ({\tt\_}), and the line will consist solely of characters with ASCII codes between 33 and 126 (inclusive).

\section*{Output}

Output four lines, containing the ratios of whitespace characters, lowercase
letters, uppercase letters, and symbols (in that order). 
Your answer should have an absolute or relative error of at most $10^{-6}$.
